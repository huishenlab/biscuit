# Visualizing BS-converted Read Mapping

The `tview` subroutine allows you to visualize mappings generated by BISCUIT.
`biscuit tview` is similar to `samtools tview`, but includes additional coloring
for reads that have undergone bisulfite conversion. One difference is that a 
reference FASTA file is required for BISCUIT so that bisulfite conversion can be
identified. Therefore, make sure you include the reference FASTA in the command.

```bash
$ biscuit tview -g chr19:7525080 my_input.bam my_reference.fa
```

In the reference, CpGs are marked in red, while C's and G's in other contexts are
marked in blue. For reads, retained C's/G's are marked in red, converted C's/G's
are marked in blue. Mismatches not related to bisulfite conversion are marked in
yellow.
