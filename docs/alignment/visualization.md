# Visualizing BS-converted Read Mapping

The `tview` subcommand allows you to visualize mappings generated by BISCUIT.
`biscuit tview` is similar to `samtools tview`, but includes additional coloring
for reads that have undergone bisulfite conversion. One difference is that a 
reference FASTA file is required for BISCUIT so that bisulfite conversion can be
identified. Therefore, make sure you include the reference FASTA in the command.

```bash
$ biscuit tview my_input.bam /path/to/my_reference.fa
```

In the reference, CpGs are marked in red, while C's and G's in other contexts
are marked in blue. For reads, retained C's/G's are marked in red, while
converted C's/G's are marked in blue. Mismatches not related to bisulfite
conversion are marked in yellow.

For more help on the available options, run `biscuit tview` in the terminal.
