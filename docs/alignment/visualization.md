# Visualizing BS-converted Read Mapping

The `tview` subcommand allows the user to visualize mappings generated by BISCUIT. `biscuit tview` is similar to
`samtools tview`, but includes additional coloring for reads that have undergone bisulfite conversion. Because of this
additional coloring, a reference FASTA file is required for `biscuit tview` so that bisulfite conversion can be
identified.

```bash
$ biscuit tview my_input.bam /path/to/my_reference.fa
```

In the reference, CpGs are marked in red, while C's and G's in other contexts are marked in blue. For reads, retained
C's/G's are marked in red, while converted C's/G's are marked in blue. Mismatches not related to bisulfite conversion
are marked in yellow.

For more help on the available options, run `biscuit tview` in the terminal or visit the 
[tview help page]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/subcommand_help.md#biscuit-tview %}).
