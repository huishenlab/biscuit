# Extract Methylation

## Make BED files

After generating the VCF file with both genetic and methylation information,
beta values and coverage can be extracted to study the methylation levels at
any sequenced CpGs. The following shows how to extract this information from
the VCF file:
```bash
$ biscuit vcf2bed -t cg my_pileup.vcf.gz > my_pileup.bed
```

The `-t` flag can be used to retrieve mutation and other information, including

  * `snp` for SNP information
  * `c` for all cytosines
  * `hcg` for HCG (from NOMe-seq)
  * `gch` for GCH (from NOMe-seq)
  
Information about the sequence context for each row can be included by adding
the `-e` flag to the command, while filtering out low coverage rows can be done
using the `-k` flag.

## Merge Neighboring C and G in CpG Context

At times, you may want to merge the beta values from the C's and G's in a CpG
dinucleotide context. This can be done using the BED file generated by BISCUIT:

```bash
$ biscuit mergecg /path/to/my_reference.fa my_pileup.bed
```
