This glossary serves as a reference for terms that can be easily misunderstood,
are used multiple ways in bioinformatics, or just need more explaining than is
given in earlier sections. Care has been taken to try and use the definitions
provided here in the same way throughout the BISCUIT documentation.

## General Terms

  - **Coverage:** Fraction of the genome that has been sequenced to a given
  *depth*.
  - **Depth:** Average number of reads covering each each base in the genome.
  - **Watson/Forward/Top Strand:** DNA strand where reading from the 5' to 3'
  end proceeds from left to right. The choice of the Watson and Crick strands
  is arbitrary, but a consistent definition should be used across an entire
  chromosome.
  - **Crick/Reverse/Bottom Strand:** DNA strand where reading from the 5' to 3'
  end proceeds from right to left. The choice of the Watson and Crick strands
  is arbitrary, but a consistent definition should be used across an entire
  chromosome.

## Bisulfite Sequencing Terms

  - **Directional Library:** Library preparation format where only only reads
  from the original top and original bottom strands can be sequenced.
  - **Non-directional Library:** Library preparation format where reads can be
  sequenced from any of the following: the original top strand, the original
  bottom strand, the complement to the original top strand, or the complement
  to the original bottom strand. Reads from each strand will be mapped with
  approximately the same frequency.
  - **Bisulfite Watson (BSW) / Original Top (OT):** Reads originating from the
  bisulfite converted Watson strand.
  - **Bisulfite Crick (BSC) / Original Bottom (OB):** Reads originating from
  the bisulfite converted Crick strand.
  - **Bisulfite Watson Reverse (BSWR) / Complement to Original Top (CTOT):**
  Complement to the bisulfite converted Watson strand.
  - **Bisulfite Crick Reverse (BSCR) / Complement to Original Bottom (CTOB):**
  Complement to the bisulfite converted Crick strand.
